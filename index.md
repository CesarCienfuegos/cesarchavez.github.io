# Carlos César Chávez Padilla

## About Me

I am a MA graduate in Public Policy at the University of Chicago's Harris School, applying to PhD programs in Economics for Fall 2026.

My research focuses on **development economics** and **political economy**, with particular emphasis on Latin America. I study how violence, institutions, and labor markets affect human capital formation and economic development.

Before coming to Chicago, I worked as a Research Analyst at the **International Monetary Fund** and as a Research Professional at **Georgetown University**. I am from Barranca, Peru, and received my BA in Economics with honors from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

## Working Papers

### The Anatomy of a Nobel Prize: Evidence from Economics Laureates (1969–2025)
*Solo author* | December 2025

What happens when an economist wins the Nobel Prize? Using novel data on all 99 laureates (1969–2025), I document five facts about paths to Stockholm: the PhD-to-Nobel gap has remained stable at 39 years; 24% of laureates trained under previous Nobel winners; productivity peaks decades before recognition; collaboration shifted from 77% solo authorship (1960s) to 15% (2020); and future Nobel winners are indistinguishable from non-winners among Clark Medal recipients. Using a difference-in-differences design, I find the Nobel generates a 25–30% citation boost to prior work but has no detectable effect on productivity or collaboration.

### Terrorism and Regional Development: Evidence from Peru's Internal War
*Solo author* | November 2025

How do regions recover from civil conflict? I study Peru's internal armed conflict (1980–2000), which claimed 69,000 lives, using district-level census data spanning 36 years. I find conflict districts experienced demographic transformation rather than restoration, with populations 2–3 years younger and 25–35% fewer elderly. Human capital converged substantially—the literacy gap narrowed by 66%. Significant heterogeneity emerges: Sendero Luminoso areas experienced complete demographic restructuring with weak educational recovery, while state-violence areas preserved demographics with strong human capital gains.

### Import Liberalization, Not Export Expansion: The Channels of Trade-Induced Poverty Reduction
*Solo author* | May 2025

Trade liberalization reduced caloric poverty in Peru despite aggregate caloric poverty rising 7.5pp (2007-2022). Using regional variation in tariff exposure from Peru's 2009 US-FTA, I find import liberalization drove all caloric poverty reduction. Manufacturing tariff cuts reduced caloric poverty 4.9pp per tariff point. Export volumes tripled yet contributed zero: production gains concentrated among commercial farmers above the poverty threshold. High-exposure departments consistently outperformed, with initially-disadvantaged regions reversing poverty rankings.

### Electoral Pressure and Political Lying: A Theory of Strategic Deception
*Solo author* | 2025

Why do politicians lie despite reputational costs? I develop a dynamic game where politicians trade off immediate electoral gains against long-term credibility losses. Using PolitiFact data on U.S. House members (2007-2025), I find final-term members lie 5.6-8.0 percentage points more than early-term members. Campaign periods increase lying by 12.1 percentage points for final-term members versus 3.6 percentage points for early-term members, confirming the predicted interaction between electoral pressure and time horizons.

### Spatial Sorting and Conflict Migration: Evidence from Peru's Internal War
*Solo author* | 2025

Do conflict migrants succeed because of who they are or where they go? Using household survey data from Peru (2004–2024) linked to geocoded conflict fatality records, I decompose migrant outcomes into selection and spatial sorting components. Spatial sorting explains 100% of conflict migrants' economic advantages: the 4.5% income premium disappears entirely with destination fixed effects. A dual selection dynamic operates: wealth determines who stays during violence, while education determines who succeeds among migrants.

### Commodity Booms and Violent Conflict: Reconciling Opportunity Cost and Rapacity
*Solo author* | November 2025

Do natural resources fuel conflict or foster peace? I resolve the resource curse puzzle by showing opportunity costs reduce state-based conflict while rapacity increases non-state conflict. Using grid-level data and commodity price shocks, I find boom-period growth reduced insurgencies by 2.65pp but intensified territorial competition by 0.49pp. Rebel casualties fell 60% more than government casualties, confirming recruitment constraints.

### When Ideas Become Mainstream: Theory and Evidence from Econometric Techniques
*Solo author* | November 2025

This paper demonstrates that diffusion operates independently across three levels—awareness, adoption, and spatial embedding—each governed by distinct mechanisms. Analyzing six econometric methods using 21,911 citations, 2,744 market observations, and 3,963 researchers (1960-2024), I find that awareness spreads smoothly through citations, but actual adoption faces substantial resistance varying 814-fold across methods.
